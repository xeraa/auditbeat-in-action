# Auditd in Action



## Features

1. See the output of `sudo aureport` and the underlying events with `sudo ausearch --raw` or filter them with `sudo ausearch --success no`. Optionally point to the rules in */etc/audit/audit.rules*.
1. Show the dashboard *[Filebeat Auditd] Audit Events ECS* and show additional Filebeat modules:
  * *[Filebeat System] New users and groups ECS*
  * *[Filebeat System] Sudo commands ECS*
1. Show the Auditbeat configuration and the raw data in the Discover tab (also point out the `host` and `meta.cloud` data).
1. Show the *[Auditbeat Auditd] Overview ECS* dashboard.
1. `ssh elastic-user@xeraa.wtf` with a bad password and show the failed login on the *[Filebeat System] SSH login attempts* dashboard.
1. SSH with the same user and make it work this time.
1. For a more fine grained filter run `cat /etc/passwd` and find the event with `tags is developers-passwd-read`.
1. Run `service nginx restart` and pick the `elastic-admin` user to run the command. Show the execution on the *[Auditbeat Auditd] Executions ECS* dashboard by filtering down to the `elastic-user` user.
1. Detect when an admin may be abusing power by looking in a user's home directory. Let the `ssh elastic-admin@xeraa.wtf` check the directory */home/elastic-user* and read the file */home/elastic-user/secret.txt* (will require sudo). Search for the tag `power-abuse` to see the violation.
1. Show */etc/auditbeat/auditbeat.yml* that requires sudo privileges and find the call in `tags is elevated-privs`.
1. Open a socket with `netcat -l 1025` and start a chat with `telnet <hostname> 1025`. Find it in the *[Auditbeat System] Socket Dashboard ECS* in the destination ports list and filter down on it. Optionally show the alternative with Auditd by filtering in *Discover* on `open-socket`.
1. Show a seccomp violation by runnin `firejail --noprofile --seccomp.drop=bind -c nc -v -l 1025`. This will show up as `"event.action": "violated-seccomp-policy"` in the Auditbeat events. Alternatively you can find the event with `dmesg` on the shell.
1. Show the other *[Auditbeat System]* dashboard and be sure to point out that this is not based on Auditd any more. For example the one listing all installed packages and their version could come in handy if there is a vulnerable binary out and you want to see where you still need to patch.
1. Change the content of the website in `/var/www/html/.index.html`. See the change in the *[Auditbeat File Integrity] Overview ECS* dashboard. Depending on the editor the actions might be slightly different; *nano* will generate an `updated` event wheras *vi* does a `moved` and `deleted`.
1. In the SIEM tab search for `1025` (the port). Drop the process `netcat` into the Timeline view and see all the related details for it. Add a comment to the event when we opened the port.



## Setup

Make sure you have run this before the demo.

1. Have your AWS account set up, access key created, and added as environment variables in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Protip: Use [https://github.com/sorah/envchain](https://github.com/sorah/envchain) to keep your environment variables safe.
1. Create the Elastic Cloud instance with the same version as specified in *variables.yml*'s `elastic_version`, enable Kibana as well as the GeoIP & user agent plugins, and set the environment variables with the values for `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `ELASTICSEARCH_USER`, `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`, as well as `KIBANA_HOST`, `KIBANA_ID`.
1. Change the settings to a domain you have registered under Route53 in *inventory*, *variables.tf*, and *variables.yml*. Set the Hosted Zone for that domain and export the Zone ID under the environment variable `TF_VAR_zone_id`. If you haven't created the Hosted Zone yet, you should set it up in the AWS Console first and then set the environment variable.
1. If you haven't installed the AWS plugin for Terraform, get it with `terraform init` first. Then create the keypair, DNS settings, and instances with `terraform apply`.
1. Apply the configuration to the instance with `ansible-playbook configure.yml`.

When you are done, remove the instances, DNS settings, and key with `terraform destroy`.



## Packer Setup for Strigo

To build an AWS AMI for [Strigo](https://strigo.io), use [Packer](https://packer.io). Using the [Ansible Local Provisioner](https://packer.io/docs/provisioners/ansible-local.html) you only need to have Packer installed locally (no Ansible). Build the AMI with `packer build packer.json` and set up the training class on Strigo with the generated AMI and the user `ubuntu`.

By setting `cloud: true` you won't add a local Elasticsearch and Kibana instance. But you must then add the `elasticsearch_user` and `elasticsearch_password` account to that cloud account for the setup to work, add `cloud.id` to all the Beats, and restart them.

If things are failing for some reason: Run `packer build -debug packer-ansible.yml`, which will keep the instance running and save the SSH key in the current directory. Connect to it with `ssh -i ec2_amazon-ebs.pem ubuntu@ec2-X-X-X-X.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com`; open ports as needed in the AWS Console since the instance will only open TCP/22 by default.


## Todo

None.
